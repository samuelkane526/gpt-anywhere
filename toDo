ToDo:
  1. Security futures,
  2. Smarter tab switching (predict the expected time for a response from a prompt, 
  and time different conversations based on said calculations. This could massivelly improve effiency.)
  3. Figure out a way to bypass bot detection while running headless. (Improve efficency of program and allow many more GPT instances to run on minimal hardware.)
